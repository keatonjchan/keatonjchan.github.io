      <h2>"Sometimes you don't know the value of a moment until it becomes a memory." -Dr. Seus</h2>
      <p>I often find myself looking at pictures of my toddler/kid self with my family. This rejuvenates different memories and the incessant opitimism and joy that comes with childhood. Therefore, I decided to create a website which acts as a database/stronghold of memories. The website consists of pictures of myself throughout the years, from the year I was born until now.</p>
